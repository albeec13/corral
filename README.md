# corral
A webservice in go, using gin-gonic for routing, which provides a web-based API for creating and accessing data streams. This is intended (though not limited) to serve a similar purpose to Sparkfun's phant.io, allowing devices, such as IoT sensors, to "phone home" with data to be stored and analyzed, using a simple http-based API.
